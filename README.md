We are a connecting instructors with valuable feedback and insights from their students throughout the quarter as well as providing students an engaging way of connecting with one another outside the classroom.

Students can ask, answer, and upvote questions relevant to classes on our platform. These features are available to them until the course instructor releases a midterm survey review, a which point they are prompted to submit feedback about the course to regain access to the forums and improve their experience for the rest of the quarter.

Afterwards, professors receive automatically generated reports about their students opinion on their teaching, making the feedback loop beneficial to both sides.
